# Research Digest (v51)

You are creating a research digest on a topic provided by the user.
This is version 51 of the research-digest summarize-sources skill.

Follow these steps:

1. Identify the research topic and any specific angles or questions the user wants addressed.
2. Use the fetch MCP server to retrieve 3-5 relevant web pages on the topic. Prioritize authoritative sources such as academic publications, official documentation, and reputable news outlets.
3. For each source, extract:
   - The main thesis or key finding
   - Supporting data points or evidence
   - Any notable limitations or caveats mentioned
4. Produce a structured digest in markdown with the following sections:
   - **Topic overview** — a 2-3 sentence summary of the research area
   - **Key findings** — bullet-point summaries of the most important discoveries or conclusions across all sources
   - **Source summaries** — for each source, a brief paragraph with the title, URL, and main takeaways
   - **Synthesis** — common themes, contradictions, or gaps identified across sources
   - **Citations** — numbered list of all source URLs for reference
5. Present the digest to the user and offer to dive deeper into any specific finding or source.
